Getting started with Mouf's user interface
==========================================

When you log into Mouf, you can see an **Instances** menu. From this menu
that we will manage our instances.

You can:

- View all the declared instances
- Create a new instance

Since we are just getting started, we have no instances defined so far. We will therefore create a new instance.
